Based on the growing need to work with 3D data, there is constant testing and research of new algorithm possibilities. The current work is devoted to the RANSAC algorithm, with the help of which it is possible to mathematically describe various groupings of points. The models can then be used for further processing of 3D data. The aim of the work is to compare the implementation of the analytical method of the RANSAC model with its extension, which also implements neural network models to achieve better results.
